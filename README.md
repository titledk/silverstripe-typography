# Typography test module

Adapted from [Sunny Side Up's module](https://github.com/sunnysideup/silverstripe-typography).


## Developers

* Nicolaas Francken [at] sunnysideup.co.nz
* Anselm Christophersen [at] title.dk

## Requirements

SilverStripe 3.0.0 or greater.

## Documentation

this module allows you to review the typography
styling in live-like setting.


## Installation Instructions

1. Find out how to add modules to SS and add module as per usual.
2. copy configurations from this module's _config.php file
into mysite/_config.php file and edit settings as required.
NB. the idea is not to edit the module at all, but instead customise
it from your mysite folder, so that you can upgrade the module without redoing the settings.
